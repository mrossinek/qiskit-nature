        orbitals.

        The orbitals to be removed are specified in two ways:
            1. When `freeze_core` is enabled (the default), the `core_orbitals` listed in the
               `QMolecule` are made inactive and removed in the same fashion as in the
               :class:`ActiveSpaceTransformer`.
            2. Additionally, unoccupied molecular orbitals can be removed via a list of indices
               passed to `remove_orbitals`. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that these are
               indeed unoccupied orbitals, as no checks are performed.

        If you want to remove additional occupied orbitals, please use the
        :class:`ActiveSpaceTransformer` instead.

            freeze_core: A boolean indicating whether to remove the molecular orbitals specified by
                        `QMolecule.core_orbitals`.
            remove_orbitals: A list of indices specifying molecular orbitals which are removed.
                             No checks are performed on the nature of these orbitals, so the user
                             must make sure that these are _unoccupied_ orbitals, which can be
                             removed without taking any energy shifts into account.
